### 3. Documentation Matters
**Insight:** Writing things down helps clarify thinking. Good documentation today saves confusion tomorrow.

### 4. Start Small, Think Big
**Insight:** Day 1 is about setup and planning. The real learning starts from Day 2 onwards. Foundation matters!

## 🤔 Challenges Faced

### Challenge 1: Repository Not Found Error
**Problem:** Initial push failed because GitHub repository didn't exist.

**Solution:** 
1. Created repository on GitHub.com first
2. Then pushed local code
3. Learned to create repo before pushing!

**Lesson:** Always create remote repository before attempting to push.

### Challenge 2: Organizing File Structure
**Problem:** Too many files in root directory looked messy.

**Solution:**
1. Created `docs/` folder for documentation
2. Created `projects/` folder for future work
3. Created `notes/` folder for learning notes
4. Kept only essential files in root

**Lesson:** Good folder structure improves maintainability.

Day 1 is about believing in the process. Day 2 is about proving I can do it.

**Tomorrow, the real journey begins! 🚀**
